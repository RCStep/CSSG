# Cobalt Strike Shellcode Generator  

Ryan Stephenson (RCStep)

Adds Shellcode - Shellcode Generator to the Cobalt Strike top menu bar

![Alt text](CSSG_gui2.png?raw=true)  

CSSG is aggressor, .NET, and python scripts used to more easily generate and format beacon shellcode  

Generates beacon stageless shellcode with exposed exit method, additional formatting, encryption, encoding, compression, multiline output, etc  

**shellcode transforms are done in the descending order they are listed in the menu**  

---

**Requirements:**  
The RC4/AES encryption option uses a python script or .NET assembly in the /assets folder  
Python based encryption depends on the pycryptodome package to be installed to perform the RC4/AES encryption  

Install pycryptodome with pip depending on your python environment:  

    python -m pip install pycryptodome
    python3 -m pip install pycryptodome
    py -3 -m pip install pycryptodome
    py -2 -m pip install pycryptodome

You can check that pycryptodome is present after the pip install with a command like:  

    python -m pip list | grep crypto

The generator will use your client host's default "python" command to launch the RC4/AES encryption script 

Your client host needs to be able to execute native .NET framework assemblies for the RC4/AES .exe backend option

***Options for the shellcode generator are:***  

**Listener:**  
Select a valid listener with the "..." button. Shellcode will be generated form this listener selection  

**Delivery:**  
Stageless (Staged not supported for the shellcode generator)  

**Exit Method:**  
process - exits the entire process that Beacon is present in when the beacon is closed  
thread - exits only the thread in which Beacon is running when the beacon is closed  

**Local Pointers Checkbox:**  
May use if you are going to execute the shellcode from an existing Beacon  
Generates a Beacon shellcode payload that inherits key function pointers from a same-arch parent Beacon  

**Existing Session:**  
The parent Beacon session where the shellcode will pull session metadata  
Shellcode should be run from within this Beacon session  

**x86 Checkbox:**  
Check to generate x86 shellcode, x64 is generated by default  

**Or Use Shellcode File:**  
Use an externally generated raw shellcode file in lieu of generating Beacon shellcode  
This allows you to use other exported Beacon files or output from other tools (Donut, msfvenom, etc)  

**Formatting:**  
raw - raw binary shellcode output, no formatting applied  
hex - hex formatted shellcode output  
0x90,0x90,0x90 - shellcode formatted into a C# style byte array     
0x90uy;0x90uy;0x90uy - shellcode formatted into a F# style byte array    
\x90\x90\x90 - shellcode formatted into a C\C++ style byte array    
UUID - shellcode transformed into UUID strings with a python script (padded with \x90s for 16 byte chunks)  
b64 - option to base64 encode the shellcode early in the generation process (before any encryption)  

**XOR Encrypt Shellcode Checkbox:**  
Check to XOR encrypt the shellcode (only one encryption type can be selected at a time)  

**XOR Key(s):**  
Randomly generated and editable XOR key character(s) to use for encryption  
Multiple characters will result in multiple rounds of XOR encryption (i.e. ABCDE)  

**RC4 Encrypt Shellcode Checkbox:**  
Check to RC4 encrypt the shellcode (only one encryption type can be selected at a time)  
Uses a python script or .NET Framework assembly to perform RC4 encryption  

**AES Encrypt Shellcode Checkbox:**  
Check to AES encrypt the shellcode (only one encryption type can be selected at a time)  
Uses a python script or .NET Framework assembly to perform AES Block Cipher AES-CBC encryption  
Shellcode is padded with \0 values to reach block size requirements  
A randomly generated IV is prepended to the encrypted shellcode data  

**RC4/AES Backend Checkbox:**  
Check to use a .NET exe assembly to encrypt your shellcode file  
Unchecked uses a python script to encrypt your shellcode file  
Encryption key byte lengths accepted for AES are 16, 24, and 32  
Encryption key byte lengths for RC4 are ANY when using .NET, and 5 bytes minium when using python  

**RC4/AES Backend tools:**  
A python script and compiled .NET assembly are in the assets directory  
Source folder for the Encryptor assembly is there as well for self compliation if you dont trust me (I wouldn't)  
Both of these tools can encrypt and decrypt RC4/AES shellcode/files  

encrypt_file.py Usage:  

    encrypt_file.py [aes/rc4] [encrypt/decrypt] [key] [input file] [output file]

Encryptor.exe Usage:  

    Encryptor.exe [aes/rc4] [encrypt/decrypt] [key] [input file] [output file]

**RC4 or AES Key**  
Randomly generated and editable RC4/AES key to use for encryption  
32 byte AES key is generated and preferred for 256 bit AES encryption strength  
AES Encryption key byte lengths accepted are 16, 24, and 32  
RC4 key lenghth is 1 byte minimum if using .NET and 5 bytes minium if using python  

**Encoding/Compression:**  
none - No additional encoding or compression is done to the shellcode  
b64 - base64 encode the shellcode  
gzip then b64 - gzip compress then base64 the shellcode  
gzip - gzip compress the shellcode  
b64 then gzip - base64 then gzip compress the shellcode  
b64 then 7xgzip - base64 then gzip compress the shellcode 7 times  

**Multiline Output:**  
Can be used for non-raw/binary output formats  
none - no multiline formatting, shellcode is one long string  
quoted - Shellcode is broken up into lines surround by quotation marks  
chunks.push_back - Shellcode is broken up into lines surrounded by chunks.push_back(" and ");  

**Multiline Length:**  
Number of shellcode characters in each line if a multiline output option is selected  

**Generate Button:**  
Select directory for shellcode output  
Defalut filename will be beacon but can be changed  
Any encryption key used will be displayed in a popup and also written the Cobalt Strike Script Console  
The byte size of the raw beacon shellcode and final formatted beacon shellcode will be displayed in a popup and also written to the Script Console  
Location of files used to generate/build the shellcode are all set the scripts/shellcode_generator.cna file
